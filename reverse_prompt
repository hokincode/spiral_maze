        """Initialize the maze game with a given layout."""

0 is open path, and 1 is wall. Top left is given by (0,0).

You initial position is at (5,6), indicated by 7. And your exit is at (3,3), indicated by 8. Do not use algorithms. Check each time if there is a wall, and comes back. Plan using language. Examine if each step is valid. Examine all possible moves in the four directions. For each three steps, do a summary, and then continue. You will not be penalized for generating very long answer.

Please provide me the linguistic plan to exit the maze.
